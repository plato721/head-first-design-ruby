Pancake House Menu: Breakfast things
-------------------------
   K&B's Pancake Breakfast(v), 2.99
      -- Pancakes with scrambled eggs and toast
   Death by pancakes, 13.99
      -- Ugh. Another boring menu item name. Should I say that it will literally kill you? Of course not. Because you'd be expecting that, too.
   Pancakes and gravy(v), 7.49
      -- It's not really gravy. It's like a sugar tar. That's also not tar. It'll make your heart beat fast and your skin break out, what's not to love?
   A pancake beyond(v), 19.99
      -- Our beyond beef pancake. The pancake that isn't a pancake or a cow!

Diner: Why is it that the spoon is always greasy?
-------------------------
   Grand Royale, 13.99
      -- A large important. A very enormous. Gigantic big big.
   Skinny Phil, 8.99
      -- Dry chicken breast, squeeze of lemon, oregano for some reason, distilled water with added asphalt particulate.
   Your Mom, 10.5
      -- 'You want my mom??'' 'No, Your Mom.'' 'That's what I said!'
   Your Sister(v), 11.99
      -- Really? You have a Your Mom and a Your Sister? Yes. This is not a mature diner.

Steakhouse: First come, first steaked
-------------------------
   Porterhouse, 55.0
      -- It's a house large enough to warrant having a porter on staff.
   Beyond Porterhouse(v), 75.0
      -- If you're a vegetarian, would you really order this? Or just get some baby corns from the salad bar?
   T-Bone, 40.0
      -- A boneless, skinless, cutlet... What do you think it is? It's a steak. With a bone in it. That resembles a T.

Dessert: If you want to poison yourself with this, we'll accept payment for it.
-------------------------
   Cake, 5.99
      -- You've seen cake, right?
   Apple Pie, 4.99
