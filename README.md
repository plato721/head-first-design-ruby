# Head First Design Patterns in Ruby

Just playing around to see what they look like. The strategy pattern is more java-y, but I think as I go on, I'm just going to think about how I might actually do it in ruby, versus trying to make the code behavior identical. Also, specs. Enjoy. And let me know what you think, as long as you're gonna be nice about it. :-)
