# Head First Design Patterns in Ruby

Just playing around to see what they look like. The Strategy pattern was done more java-y (simulating interfaces and such), but I think as I go on, I'm just going to think about how I might actually do it in Ruby, versus trying to make the code behavior identical. Also, specs.

## Update for Observer Pattern

I'm losing steam on this.. Writing minutiae when I'm trying to instill the design patterns. But I felt pot-committed to Observer, so it is present to the extent the given Java examples are, plus some testing.
